Exercise: Write a program that reads a text file, specified by the first command line argument, into a List.
The program should then print random lines from the file, the number of lines printed to be specified
by the second command line argument. Write the program so that a correctly-sized collection is allocated
all at once, instead of being gradually expanded as the file is read in. Hint: To determine the number
of lines in the file, use java.io.File.length to obtain the size of the file, then divide by an assumed
size of an average line. 
Answer: 
Since we are accessing the List randomly, we will use ArrayList. 
We estimate the number of lines by taking the file size and dividing by 50.
We then double that figure, since it is more efficient to overestimate than to underestmate.

/*
This program actually spends most of its time reading in the file, 
so pre-allocating the ArrayList has little affect on its performance. 
Specifying an initial capacity in advance is more likely to be useful when your program repeatly
 creates large ArrayList objects without intervening I/O.
